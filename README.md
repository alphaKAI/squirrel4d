# SQUIRREL4D
The implementation of squirrel language in pure D.  

# Why D?
I think there is no embeddable language to application written in D yet.  
You may recall some projects which connects D and Script Language, but I think there are only a bindings.  
If I develop this, you(All D Programmer) can embeded this language to your application without any other language, no bindings by simple way.  
Therefore I decide to develop embeddable VM based script language in pure D even it require a lot of work.  

# Development Status
* Currently, doesn't quite work yet.
* (Not yet) First I need to read original Squirrel Language Implementation.
* (Not yet) Translate Orignal C++ implementation into D(Not a merely translation, I'll translate as D way)
